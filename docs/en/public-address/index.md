title: Address types
---
Monero addresses are what you publish/share to receive transactions.    
Addresses can be generated offline, for free.

There are a few **types of public addresses** in Monero:

* [Standard address](./standard-address.md) - the wallet's primary address, often referred to as your "main" address.
* [Subaddress](./subaddress.md) - recommended address type.
* [Integrated address](./integrated-address.md) - some exchanges, merchants, and other businesses accepting Monero may opt to use these instead of subaddresses.
